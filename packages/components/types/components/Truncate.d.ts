/**
 * `Truncate` is a typography primitive that trims text content. For almost all cases, it is recommended that `Text`, `Heading`, or `Subheading` is used to render text content. However, `Truncate` is available for custom implementations.

 * ```jsx
 * import { Truncate } from `@wp-g2/components`
 *
 * function Example() {
 *   return (
 *     <Truncate>
