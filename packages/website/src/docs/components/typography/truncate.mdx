# Truncate

`Truncate` is a typography primitive that trims text content. For almost all cases, it is recommended that `Text`, `Heading`, or `Subheading` is used to render text content. However, `Truncate` is available for custom implementations.

## Usage

```jsx live
import { Truncate } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return (
    <Truncate>
      Where the north wind meets the sea, there's a river full of memory. Sleep,
      my darling, safe and sound, for in this river all is found. In her waters,
      deep and true, lay the answers and a path for you. Dive down deep into her
      sound, but not too far or you'll be drowned
    </Truncate>
  )
}
```

## Props

| Name          | Type      | Default | Description                                                          |
| ------------- | --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ellipsis      | `string`  | `...`   | The ellipsis string when `truncate` is set.                          |
| ellipsizeMode | `string`  | `auto`  | Determines where to truncate. `truncate` must first be set.          |
| limit         | `number`  | `0`     | Determines the max characters when `truncate` is set.                |
| numberOfLines | `boolean` |         | Determines how many lines to truncate. `truncate` must first be set. |

### ellipsizeMode

For example, we can truncate text right in the middle. To do this, we need to set `ellipsizeMode` to `middle` and a text `limit`.

Available `ellipsizeMode` values include:

| Name   | Description                                               |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| auto   | Trims content at the end automatically without a `limit`. |
| head   | Trims content at the beginning. Requires a `limit`.       |
| middle | Trims content in the middle. Requires a `limit`.          |
| tail   | Trims content at the end. Requires a `limit`.             |

```jsx live
import { Truncate } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return (
    <Truncate ellipsizeMode="middle" limit={40}>
      Where the north wind meets the sea, there's a river full of memory. Sleep,
      my darling, safe and sound, for in this river all is found. In her waters,
      deep and true, lay the answers and a path for you. Dive down deep into her
      sound, but not too far or you'll be drowned
    </Truncate>
  )
}
```

### numberOfLines

Clamps the text content to the specifiec `numberOfLines`, adding the `ellipsis` at the end.

```jsx live
import { Truncate } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return (
    <Truncate numberOfLines={2}>
      Where the north wind meets the sea, there's a river full of memory. Sleep,
      my darling, safe and sound, for in this river all is found. In her waters,
      deep and true, lay the answers and a path for you. Dive down deep into her
      sound, but not too far or you'll be drowned
    </Truncate>
  )
}
```
