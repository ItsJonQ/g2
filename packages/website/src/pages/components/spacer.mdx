# Spacer

`Spacer` is a primitive layout component that providers inner (`padding`) or outer (`margin`) space in-between components. It can also be used to adaptively provide space within an [`HStack`](/components/hstack/) or [`VStack`](/components/vstack/).

### Usage

```jsx live
import { Spacer } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Spacer>
        <Heading>Into the unknown</Heading>
      </Spacer>
      <Text>
        Every day's a little harder as I feel your power grow. Don't you know
        there's part of me that longs to go.
      </Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

### Props

`Spacer` comes with a bunch of shorthand props to adjust `margin` and `padding`. The values of these props work as a multiplier to the library's grid system (base of `4px`).
